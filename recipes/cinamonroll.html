        <img src="../recipes/foodpics/cinamon.jpg" alt="Cinamon Roll picture" height="310" width="310">
        <p> I stole this recipe from my boyfriend who is a baker. These are the most delicious cinamon rolls  I have ever tried. They are really the fluffiest and have the perfect balance between flavors and sugar. And to top it out the icing is made with cream cheese which I am a big fan of.  I love them so much I constantly ask him to make them for me and I figure I would share it with you guys!.</p>
        <p>This recipe is made from scratch but really easy to follow and doesnt need many crazy ingredients. You may already have them all at home.</p>
